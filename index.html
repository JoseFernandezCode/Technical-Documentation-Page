            CSS3 serves a fundamental purpose in web development by providing a
            means to style and format web pages. Its primary goal is to separate
            the presentation layer from the structure and content layer of a web
            document, resulting in cleaner and more maintenable code. Here are
            some specific purposes of CSS3 in web development:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Styling: CSS3 allows web developers to control the visual
              appereance of elements on a web page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layout and Positioning: CSS3 provides flexible and precise control
              over the layout and positioning elements. With CSS3, developers
              can creater multi-column layouts, control the placement od
              elements within a page, and achieve responsive designs that adapt
              to different screen sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consistency and Branding: CSS3 allows developers to establish
              consistent styles across an entire website by defining styles in a
              centralized manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adaptability: CSS3 enables web pages to adapt to various devices
              and screen sizes, supporting responsive design. By using Media
              Queries and other CSS3 techniques, developers can create layout
              and styles that adjust automatically to provide optimal viewing
              experiences on different devices.

        <article>
          <p>
            CSS3 offers a variety of Selectors that allow developers to target
            specific elements in HTML documents for styling. Selectors determine
            which elements on a web page are affected by CSS rules. Here are
            some common CSS3 selectors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Element Selector:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Syntax:
                  <p><code>elementname { styles }</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Targets: All elements of a especific HTML tag. For example:
                  <p><code>body {background-color: black;}</code></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Class Selector:
              <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Targets: Elements with especific class attribute value. For
                  example:

                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Pseudo-Elements:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Syntax:

                  <p><code>element::pseudo-element {styles}</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Targets: Especific parts of an element. For example:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Syntax:

                  <p><code>element1 element2 {styles}</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Targets: Elements that are descendant of another element. For
                  example:

                  <p><code>body p {font-family: Verdana;}</code></p>
                  <p>
                    Targets all 'p' elements that are descendant from 'body'
                    element.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Box_Model">
        <header>Box Model</header>
        <p>
          The Box Model defines how elements are structured and how their
          dimensions and spacing are calculated. It consist on four components:
          content, padding, border and margin.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an explanation of each component of the Box Model:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Content:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The content area refers to the actual space ocupied by the
                element's content, such as text, image, or other nested
                elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Its size its determined by porperties like:
                <span>'width'</span> or <span>'height'</span>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Padding:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The padding is the space between the content and the element's
                border.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be set using properties like
                <span>'padding-top'</span>, <span>'padding-right'</span>,
                <span>'padding-bottom'</span>, <span>'padding-left'</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Padding adds space internally, increasing space between the
                content and the border.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Border:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The border surrounds the content and padding of an element.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be styled using properties like
                <span>'border-width'</span>, <span>'border-style'</span>,
                <span>'border-color'</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Border can have different thicknesses, styles(solid, dashed,
                etc.) and colors.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The margin is the space outside the element's border, providing
                separation from neighboring elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be set using properties like
                <span>'margin-top'</span>, <span>'margin-right'</span>,
                <span>'margin-bottom'</span>, <span>'margin-left'</span>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Margin's create space externally, controlling the distance
                between the element and adjacent elements.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The total space occupied by an element is calculated by summing up
              the content, padding, border and margin. For example, the total
              width of an element is calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code
                >Total width: width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left
                + border-right + margin-left + margin-right</code
              >
            </p>

        <header>Layout and Positioning</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            CSS3 provides several techniques for layout and positioning of
            elements on a web page. These techniques allows web developers to
            control the arragement of elements and create various responsive
            designs. Here's some common CSS3 layout and positioning properties:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Normal Flow:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  By default, elements follow the normal flow of the document,
                  known as the flow layout. elements are displayed one after
                  another, vertically or horizontally, depending on their
                  display property (e.g., <span>'block'</span>,
                  <span>'inline'</span>, and <span>'inline-block'</span>).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The normal flow can be influenced by properties like
                  <span>'float'</span>, <span>'clear'</span>, and
                  <span>'position'</span>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Positioning:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 introduces different positioning schemes for elements:
                  <span>'static'</span>, <span>'relative'</span>,
                  <span>'absolute'</span>, and <span>'fixed'</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>'static'</span>: This is the default positioning.
                  Elements are placed in the normal flow of the document.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>'relative'</span>: Elements are positioned relative to
                  their normal position. It allows you to use properties like
                  <span>'top'</span>, <span>'right'</span>,
                  <span>'bottom'</span>, and <span>'left'</span> to off set the
                  element from its normal position without affecting other
                  elements layout.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>'absolute'</span>: Elements are removed from the normal
                  flow and positioned relative to their nearest positioned
                  ancestor (ancestor with a positioning other than
                  <span>'static'</span>) or the document's initial containing
                  block. It allows precise positioning on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>'fixed'</span>: Elements are removed from the normal
                  flow of the document and positioned relative to the viewport.
                  They remain fixed in the same position even when the user
                  scrolls the page.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Float:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <span>'float'</span> property allows elements to be
                  shifted to one side, either left or right, taking them out of
                  the normal flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Floating elements are commonly used for creating column-based
                  layouts or wrapping text around images.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, floating elements may cause container elements to
                  collapse, wich can be addressed by using the
                  <span>'clear'</span> property.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexbox:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 Flexbox is a powerful layout model designed to align and
                  distribute elements within a container.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It allows developers to create flexible and responsive
                  layouts, adjusting to different screen sizes and orientations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By setting the parent container's

              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 allows web developers to use customs fonts on their web
                  pages, not limited to the standard fonts available on users
                  systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <span>'@font-face'</span> rule enables you to load custom

          <p>
            CSS3 provides powerful features for creating smooth transitions,
            transformations and animations, allowing web developers to add
            dynamic and interactive elements to their web pages. Here's a brief
            explanation of each of these CSS3 features:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Transitions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 transitions allows for smooth changes in property values
                  over a specified duration, creating animated effects when a
                  property is modified.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To use transitions, you define the starting and the ending
                  property values, along with the duration and timing functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Commonly, transitioned properties include
                  <span>'color'</span>, <span>'background-color'</span>,
                  <span>'opacity'</span>, <span>'width'</span>,
                  <span>'height'</span>, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transitions are triggered when an element undergoes a change,
                  such as on hover, focus, or other user interactions.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Transformations:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 transformations enable developers to modify the
                  appereance and layout of elements, including rotating,
                  scaling, skewing, and translating (moving) them in 2D and 3D
                  space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transformations are achieved using the
                  <span>'transform'</span> property, and variuos transformation
                  functions, such as <span>'rotate()'</span>,
                  <span>'scale()'</span>, <span>'skew()'</span>, and
                  <span>'translate()'</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Combined with transitions or animations, transformations can
                  create engaging effects like rotating icons on hover or
                  scaling images during user interactions.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Animations:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 animations allow developers to create complex and
                  customized animations by defining keyframes and specifying how
                  an element should change at each frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keyframes are defined using the
                  <span>'@keyframes'</span> rule, where you set specific styles
                  at various points in the animation timeline (e.g. 0%, 50%,
                  100%).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The animation is then applied using the
                  <span>'animation'</span> property, wich includes information
                  like the animation name, duration, timing function, delay, and
                  iteration count.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Animations can be used to create looping effects, transitions
                  between different states, and more sophisticated animations
                  involving multiple properties.
                </li>

        <article>
          <p>
            Responsive design is a web development approach that aims to create
            wesites that adapt and respond gracefully to different screen sizes,
            devices, and orientations. CSS3 plays a crucial role in achieving
            responsive design, allowing web developers to adjust the layout and
            styling of elements based on the user's device or viewport size.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Media Queries:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Media Queries are a core feature of CSS3 that enable
                  developers to apply different styles based on the
                  characteristics of the user's device or viewport.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By using media queries, developers can set breakpoints at
                  specific screen widths and change the layout or style
                  accordingly. For example, you can set CSS rules that apply
                  only when the screen width is below a certain value(e.g., for
                  mobile devices).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexible layouts:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 introduces flexible layout techniques like
                  <span>'flexbox'</span> and <span>'grid'</span>, wich allow
                  elements to adjust automatically adjust their size and
                  positioning based on the available space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexbox and grid layout are particularly useful in creating
                  responsive designs where the arragement of elements needs to
                  change dynamically to fit different screen sizes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Relative Units:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS3 offers relative units like <span>'em'</span>,
                  <span>'rem'</span>, and <span>'%'</span>, wich are valuable in
                  responsive design as they scale proportionally with the base
                  font size or the parent container.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Relative units allow developers to create fluid layouts and
                  text that adapt to changes in viewport size.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Image Media Adaptation:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Responsive design includes optimizing images and media for
                  various devices. This can be achieved using CSS3 properties
                  like <span>'max-width'</span>, and
                  <span>'max-height'</span> to ensure images and media don't
                  exceed certaing dimensions, preventing them form overflowing
                  or causing layout issues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile-First Approach:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A common practice in responsive design is the 'Mobile-First'
                  approach, where the default styles are tailored to mobile
                  devices with smaller screens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As the screen size increases, CSS and media queries rules can
                  be used to enhance the layout and presentation for larger
                  screens, such as tablets and desktops.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Testings and Cross-Browser Compatibility:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Responsive Designs requires Thorough testing across various
                  devices, browsers, and operating system to ensure consistent
                  and user-friendly experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  CSS3 features used for responsive design should be chosen
                  carefully, considering the level of support across different
                  browsers.

                  etc.) may have varying support levels for CSS3 features, wich
                  can lead to inconsistent appereance or functionality across
                  different web browsers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To ensure consistent user experience, developers must test
                  their websites on various browsers and versions, identifying
                  and addresing any discrepancies.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Vendor Prefixes:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vendor prefixes are a mechanism used to implement CSS3
                  properties and features that are not yet standarized and may
                  have varying levels of support across different browsers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each vendor browser may introduce specific prefix before
                  property name to indicate that the feature is experimental and
                  subject to change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For example, <span>'-webkit-'</span> is the vendor prefix used
                  by Webkit based browsers
                  <span>(Safari, some versions of Chrome)</span>, while
                  <span>('-moz-')</span> is used by Mozilla based browsers
                  (e.g., Mozilla Firefox).
                </li>
                <li>
                  To use a CSS3 property with a vendor prefix, you write the
                  property name with the prefix before it, like this:
                  <span>('-webkit-border-radius')</span>
                  <span>('-moz-transform')</span>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When working with browser compatibility and vendor prefixes,
                developers need to consider the following best practices:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Progressive enhancement: Start with a basic foundation of
                  basic styles and functionality that work across all browsers.
                  Then, progressively enhance the design and features using CSS3
                  ans other advance techniques for modern browsers that supports
                  them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Features Detection: Use feature detections methods (e.g.,
                  Modernizr library or <span>'@supports'</span> rule in CSS) to
                  check whether a specific CSS3 feature is supperted before
                  applying it. This allows you to provide fallback styles or
                  alternative functionality for browsers that lack support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Autoprefixer: To avoid manually adding vendor prefixes,
                  developers can use tools like (Autoprefixer), this tool
                  automatically adds the necessary vendor prefixes based on the
                  compatibility requierements you specify, streamlining the
                  process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep abreast of browser updates: Stay informed about new CSS3
                  features, updates, and browser support by regularly checking
                  official documentation, CSS specifications, and compatibility
                  tables.
